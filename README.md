# AI Workforce

## Introduction
This project should ingest a text requirements spec and create an output file and / or set of code files. The necessity for this has come from the fact that chat GPT and other models struggle with more than just a basic project spec. I want to create a virtual AI workforce that communicates with other AI workers to modularise and complete tasks.

## Setup
To setup locally follow these steps:

1. Install node js using the official website https://nodejs.org/en
2. (for dev work) Install the following vs code extensions
  - ESLint
  - Prettier
    - Run `npm install eslint prettier eslint-plugin-react eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier --save-dev`
  - Simple React Snippets
